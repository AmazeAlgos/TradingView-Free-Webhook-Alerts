You must finish the following steps before using the program.

1. Make a copy of the [`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml).
2. Rename the copied file to `config.toml`.
3. Open `config.toml` with any text editor you like.
4. Fill in `email_address` and `login_password` with your email and password.
5. Fill in `imap_server_address` and `imap_server_port` with your email server and port. (For example, if you are using Hotmail, it will be `outlook.office365.com` and `993`, Gmail will be `imap.gmail.com` and `993`.)
6. Fill in `webhook_urls` with your webhook service URLs.

##### < Gmail >
1. Enable `2-Step Verification` on your Gmail account.
2. Create an **App Password** for the program to use. (Please read through this [article](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) for more information.) It is recommended to choose `Other (Custom name)` as the app in order to make it easier to identify in the future.
3. Fill in `email_address` and `login_password` with your email and the app  password.
4. Enable **IMAP** in your email account. (Please read through this [article](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229) for more information.)

3. Fill in the `Alert name` and your webhook message in `Message`.
4. Save the alert.
